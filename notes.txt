This notes help me to understand the required business logic


- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every product. (update price, sellIn)


Once the sell by date has passed, price degrades twice as fast.
sellIn > 1 --> price = price - 1
sellIn < 1 --> price = price - 2


The price of a product is never negative. (Min = 0)
The price of a product is never more than 50. (Max = 50)


"Full Coverage" actually increases in price the older it gets.
price = price + 1

"Mega Coverage", being a legendary product, never has to be sold or decreases in price. (price constant)

"Special Full Coverage", like full coverage, increases in price as its sellIn value approaches:

price increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
sellIn > 10 --> price = price + 1
sellIn in [6,10] --> price = price + 2
sellIn in [1,5] --> price = price + 3

price drops to 0 when no more days left (and the product is not valid anymore). 
sellIn < 1 --> price = 0

"Super Sale" Products degrade in price twice as fast as normal Products.
sellIn > 1 --> price = price - 2
sellIn < 1 --> price = price - 4
